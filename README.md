  Task 1 : Chatbot for FAQs :
                  ● Collect FAQs related to a topic or product (questions and their answers).
                  ● Preprocess the text using NLP libraries like NLTK or SpaCy (tokenize, clean, etc.).
                  ● Match user questions with the most similar FAQ using techniques like cosine similarity or intent matching.
                  ● Display the best matching answer as a chatbot response.
                  ● Optional: Create a simple chat UI for user interaction.

  Task 2 : Object Detection and Tracking :
                  ● Set up real-time video input using a webcam or video file (OpenCV).
                  ● Use a pre-trained model like YOLO or Faster R-CNN for object detection.
                  ● Process each video frame to detect objects and draw bounding boxes.
                  ● Apply object tracking using algorithms like SORT or Deep SORT.
                  ● Display the output with labels and tracking IDs in real time
